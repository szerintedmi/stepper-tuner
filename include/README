## AccessPoint credentials

Create a `secrets.h` file with the credentials for the AccessPoint to override the defaults:

```c++
# define MESH_SSID "YourMeshSSID"
# define MESH_PASS "YourMeshPassword"
```

NB: This AP is used to configure your WIFI but also launched when WIFI is configured for mesh nodes.
